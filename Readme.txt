How to Run the Program:


In the main function, the Decision Tree object is being formed in the following way:

tree = DecisionTree(maxDepth = 2, trainPath = "CarTrain.csv", testPath="CarTest.csv", className = "class")


You just need to change the parameters for maxDepth, give your training dataset path, testing dataset path, and className is the name of the class attribute in the dataset.
